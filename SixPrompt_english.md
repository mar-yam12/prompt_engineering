## Intro: Why Prompting Skills Matter

Many people use AI like ChatGPT the wrong way. They ask short or unclear questions, no background, and miss AI’s full power.  

This guide teaches a **6-step framework** to get professional results from any AI tool – productivity 10x better!

### Why Learn Prompting?

- **Better Jobs:** AI is everywhere  
  - Doctors: Diagnose faster  
  - Engineers: Solve problems quicker  
  - Lawyers: Research faster  
- **Work With AI:** Learn to team up instead of fear AI  
- **Problem:** Vague prompts = vague answers. Use framework for clear outputs  

**Magic of Framework:** 6 steps:  
**Command, Context, Logic, Roleplay, Formatting, Questions**  
- Use every time  
- Results 10x better  
- Analogy: Like a recipe – miss steps = fail, follow steps = perfect  

**Example:**  
- Bad: `"Help me with email."`  
- Good: Use all 6 steps → professional email  

**Tip:** Practice **1 prompt daily** – skill + memory boost

## Step 1: Command – Start Strong

**What:** Begin prompt with a clear, strong command.  

**How:**  
1. Use action verbs: `Write, Create, List, Explain`  
2. State your goal clearly: `"Create a plan"`  
3. AI focuses, avoids random answers  

**Analogy:** Army orders – `"Attack now!"` vs `"Maybe do it."`  

**Example:**  
- Weak: `"Maybe write something about coffee."`  
- Strong: `"Create a 5-step marketing plan for a new coffee shop."`

**When to Use:** First part of every prompt  
**Tip:** Avoid lazy words like `"Try to"`  
**Exam Note:** Command = strong start → better results

## Step 2: Context – Give Enough Info

**What:** Give AI background info – details, history, examples  

**How:**  
1. Add **Details**: Who, What, Why, When  
2. Add **Examples**: 1-2 real samples  
3. AI uses context to understand better  

**Analogy:** Tell a friend full story before asking advice  

**Example:**  
- Little context: `"Write a plan."`  
- More context: `"Coffee shop in city, budget $5000, target busy workers, past ads failed."`

**When:** Complex tasks (stories, analysis)  
**Tip:** Use bullets for long info  
**Exam Note:** Context = AI’s memory → more = smarter

## Step 3: Logic – Structure Output

**What:** Tell AI how to organize output – order, steps, flow  

**How:**  
1. Give flow: `"Start with goal, then steps, end with tips"`  
2. Use structure: Numbered list, bullets  

**Analogy:** Recipe steps – no random order  

**Example:**  
- No logic: `"Plan banao."`  
- With logic: `"Start with intro, then 3 action steps, end with measurement. Use numbered list."`

**When:** Plans, reports  
**Tip:** Say `"Follow this flow strictly"` if AI forgets  
**Exam Note:** Logic = clarity

## Step 4: Roleplay – Make AI Expert

**What:** Give AI a role → expert-level answers  

**How:**  
1. Pick role: `"Doctor, CEO, Nutritionist"`  
2. Prompt: `"As [role], do [task]"`  
3. AI changes tone and knowledge  

**Example:**  
- Generic: `"Give diet advice."`  
- Roleplay: `"As nutrition expert with 10 years experience, give weekly diet plan."`

**When:** Advice, explanations  
**Tip:** Don’t make role too extreme  
**Exam Note:** Roleplay = generic → pro answer

---

## Step 5: Formatting – Make Output Clear

**What:** Tell AI how to format – bullets, headings, tables  

**How:**  
1. Style: Bullets, headings, code blocks  
2. Instruction: `"Use bold headings, - for bullets"`  

**Analogy:** Book design – clean & attractive  

**Example:**  
- No format: plain text  
- With format: `"Bold headings, bullets, table for data"`

**When:** Emails, posts  
**Tip:** Say `"Use Markdown exactly"` if format messy  
**Exam Note:** Formatting = professional look

---

## Step 6: Questions – Extra Thinking

**What:** Add questions → AI reasons better  

**How:**  
1. Add questions: `"Why this? What if? How improve?"`  
2. Add at end: `"Answer these too"`  

**Analogy:** Like an interview – deep answers  

**Example:**  
- No questions: `"Plan banao."`  
- With questions: `"Plan banao, then answer: What risks? How track success? Alternatives?"`

**When:** Problem-solving, brainstorming  
**Tip:** 2-3 focused questions  
**Exam Note:** Questions = thinking trigger

## Final Tips: Using the Framework

**Full Prompt Example:**  

- Command: `"Create plan."`  
- Context: `"For startup."`  
- Logic: `"3 steps."`  
- Roleplay: `"As CEO."`  
- Formatting: `"Bullets."`  
- Questions: `"What are risks?"`

**Practice:** Make 1 prompt daily → test AI  
**Tip 2025:** Multimodal AI → add `"Describe image too"`  
**Exam Prep:** Remember steps = **C-C-L-R-F-Q**  
(Command, Context, Logic, Roleplay, Formatting, Questions)
