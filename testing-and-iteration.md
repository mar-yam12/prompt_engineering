# 🧪 Prompt Testing and Evaluation Framework

This document covers the full **prompt testing lifecycle**: automation, success criteria, categorization, version control, A/B testing, evaluation, and metrics.  
It is structured for clarity and practical usage.

---

## 1️⃣ Automation with Scripts

- Write a **Python** or **JavaScript** script to send multiple test prompts.  
- Log model responses and automatically flag failures.  
- Generate a **pass/fail report** at the end.

---

## 2️⃣ Define Success Criteria

- Output includes **3 key points**.  
- Response tone = **formal and professional**.  
- Length ≤ 100 tokens.  
- Must **not contain hallucinated facts**.

---

## 3️⃣ Categorize Test Cases

Divide test prompts into functional areas:

- **Summarization**  
- **Translation**  
- **Creative writing**  
- **Data extraction**  
- **Rewriting**

> This helps identify weak areas for improvement.

---

## 4️⃣ Version Control and Logging

Save for each test:

- **Model version** (e.g., GPT-5)  
- **Prompt version and parameters**  
- **Time/date of test**  
- **Observations** (accuracy %, clarity, tone)

**Example log:**

# A/B Test Different Approaches

A/B testing compares multiple prompt versions to find which produces better results.

### 🔹 Examples

**Summarization Prompt**  
- A: “Summarize this article in 2 sentences.”  
- B: “Give a concise 2-sentence summary highlighting the main idea.”

**Tone Variation**  
- A: “Write a professional apology email.”  
- B: “Write a warm, empathetic apology email to a customer.”

**Creative Writing**  
- A: “Write a bedtime story about a dragon.”  
- B: “Write a 100-word bedtime story about a friendly dragon for children under 10.”

**Instruction Clarity**  
- A: “Explain quantum computing.”  
- B: “Explain quantum computing in simple words for a beginner.”

**Output Format**  
- A: “List benefits of remote work.”  
- B: “List 5 benefits of remote work in bullet points.”

# Evaluate Results

Evaluation measures how well outputs meet goals using **qualitative** and **quantitative** methods.

### 🔹 Examples

**Manual Human Review**  
- Rate outputs on accuracy, tone, and clarity (1–5 scale).

**Checklist Evaluation**  
- ✅ Does the response answer the question fully?  
- ✅ Is the tone appropriate?  
- ✅ Grammar correct?  
- ❌ Any hallucinated facts?

**Automated Quality Testing**  
- Count tokens  
- Detect key phrases  
- Measure text similarity  
- Identify missing information

**Error Pattern Analysis**  
- Identify common issues: wrong tone, missing facts, unstructured output  
- Revise prompts to address weak areas

**User Feedback**  
- Deploy prompts and gather ratings: thumbs up/down, stars, surveys

---

# Common Evaluation Metrics

Metrics provide **objective measures** to compare prompts or prompt versions.

### 🔹 Examples

**Accuracy (%)**  
- Correct responses ÷ total responses × 100  
- Example: 45/50 correct → 90% accuracy

**Coherence Score**  
- How logically and smoothly the text flows  
- Rated by humans or automated NLP models

**Readability Index**  
- Flesch-Kincaid or Gunning Fog index  
- Ideal for general audience: grade 8–10

**Response Diversity**  
- Count unique responses for the same prompt  
- Example: 5 outputs, 4 unique → high diversity

**User Satisfaction Rating**  
- Collect ratings: stars, thumbs, surveys  
- Example: Avg 4.6/5 from 120 users

## ✅ Summary Table

| Step | Purpose | Techniques / Tools |
|------|---------|------------------|
| Testing Framework | Evaluate prompts systematically | JSON sets, scripts, logging |
| Automation | Run multiple prompts efficiently | Python/JS scripts, pass/fail reports |
| Define Success Criteria | Ensure quality outputs | Tone, key points, length, factuality |
| Categorize Tests | Identify weak areas | Summarization, Translation, Creative, Data extraction, Rewriting |
| Version Control | Track iterations | Model version, prompt version, date, observations |
