## Intro: Why Prompting Skills Matter

Most people use AI like ChatGPT wrong. They start new chats with broken or short questions, no background info, and miss AI's full power.  

This guide teaches a **6-step framework** to get pro results from any AI tool – productivity 10x up!

### Why Learn Prompting?

- **Future Job Edge:** AI everywhere.  
  - Doctors use it for diagnosis  
  - Engineers solve problems  
  - Lawyers speed research  
- **Don't Fear AI:** Team up with AI – prompting skills = super advantage in 2025  
- **Real Problem:** Vague prompts = vague answers. Framework = clear, amazing outputs

**Framework Magic:** Follow 6 steps:  
**Command, Context, Logic, Roleplay, Formatting, Questions**  
- Use in every prompt  
- Results = 10x better  
- Analogy: Like a recipe – missing steps = failure; complete steps = perfect result

**Quick Example:**  
- Bad prompt: `"Help me with email."`  
- Good (full framework): Step-by-step professional email  

**Tip:** Practice **1 prompt daily** – memory + skill boost

## Step 1: Command – Start Strong, Not Soft

**What:** Begin prompt with a strong command – direct action, not vague.  

**How It Works:**

1. Use action verbs: `Write, Analyze, Create, List`  
2. Make goal clear: `"Create a plan"`  
3. AI focuses on the command, avoids randomness  

**Analogy:** Army orders – `"Attack now!"` vs `"Chalo dekhte hain."`  

**Easy Example:**

- **Soft (Wrong):** `"Maybe write something about coffee."`  
- **Strong (Right):** `"Create a 5-step marketing plan for a new coffee shop."`

**When to Use:** Start of every prompt  
**Real Example:** Sales: `"List 10 email templates for leads"` → quick wins  
**Challenges:** Avoid lazy words like `"Try to"`  
**Exam Note:** Command = foundation → strong start = better end

## Step 2: Context – More is Always Better

**What:** Give AI full background: details, history, examples  

**How It Works:**

1. Add **Details**: Who, What, Why, When  
2. Add **Examples**: 1-2 real samples  
3. AI uses context to match patterns  

**Analogy:** Explain full story to a friend, then ask advice  

**Easy Example:**

- **Less Context (Wrong):** `"Write a plan."`  
- **More (Right):** `"Context: Coffee shop in city, budget $5000, target busy workers who want quick drinks. Past ads failed on social media."`

**When to Use:** Complex tasks (stories, analysis)  
**Challenges:** Long prompts → token waste. Use bullet points  
**Exam Note:** Context = AI's "Memory" → more = smarter

---

## Step 3: Logic – Define the Output Structure

**What:** Tell AI how to structure output – order, steps, flow  

**How It Works:**

1. Flow: `"First goal, then steps, end with tips"`  
2. Structure: Numbered lists, bullets  

**Analogy:** Recipe steps – no random order  

**Easy Example:**

- **No Logic (Wrong):** `"Plan banao."`  
- **With Logic (Right):** `"Logic: Start with intro goal, then 3 action steps, end with measurement. Use numbered list."`

**When/Why:** Plans, reports  
**Challenges:** AI may forget structure → say `"Strictly follow this flow"`  
**Exam Note:** Logic = order for clarity

---

## Step 4: Roleplay – Transform Generic into Expert-Level

**What:** Assign AI a role/character → expert-level answers  

**How It Works:**

1. Select role: `"Doctor", "Nutritionist", "CEO"`  
2. Prompt: `"As [role], do [task]"`  
3. AI adjusts tone & knowledge  

**Easy Example:**

- **Generic (Wrong):** `"Diet advice do."`  
- **Roleplay (Right):** `"As nutrition expert with 10 years experience, give weekly diet plan for weight loss."`

**When/Why:** Advice, explanations  
**Challenges:** Avoid over-the-top roles  
**Exam Note:** Roleplay = generic → pro upgrade

---

## Step 5: Formatting – Structure for Success

**What:** Specify output format – bullets, headings, tables  

**How It Works:**

1. Style: Bullets, headings, code blocks  
2. Instructions: `"Use bold for headings, - for lists"`  

**Analogy:** Book design – clean & attractive  

**Easy Example:**

- **No Format (Wrong):** Plain long text  
- **With Format (Right):** `"Headings bold, - bullets, table for data if needed"`

**When/Why:** Emails, posts  
**Challenges:** AI format may mess → say `"Use Markdown exactly"`  
**Exam Note:** Formatting = readable & professional

---

## Step 6: Questions – The Secret Sauce

**What:** Add questions to prompt → AI reasoning improves  

**How It Works:**

1. Questions: `"Why this? What if? How improve?"`  
2. Add at end: `"Answer these questions too"`  

**Analogy:** Interview – deep answers  

**Easy Example:**

- **No Questions (Wrong):** `"Plan banao."`  
- **With Questions (Right):** `"Plan banao, phir answer: What risks? How track success? Alternatives kya?"`

**When/Why:** Problem-solving, brainstorming  
**Challenges:** Too many questions confuse → 2-3 focused  
**Exam Note:** Questions = thinking trigger
