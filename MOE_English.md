## 1. What is Mixture of Experts (MoE)? - Basic Idea

MoE is a smart way to build AI models by dividing a large model into smaller "experts". Each expert focuses on one task. A **router** decides which expert to use for each input.

**Example:**
- Hospital: Surgeon (for surgery), General doctor (for checkups)  
- Receptionist (router) sends the patient to the right doctor

**History:**
- Started in 1991, popularized in 2021 by Google's Switch Transformer  
- Used in LLMs in 2025 like Mixtral

**Exam Tip:**
- MoE = Efficiency through specialization  
- "Mixture" = multiple experts, "Experts" = specialists

## 2. How Does MoE Work? - Step by Step

1. **Input:** Your data or prompt is converted into numbers (embeddings).  
2. **Router Decision:** Router decides which expert(s) to use (softmax probabilities).  
3. **Experts Work:** Only selected experts activate; others stay in sleep mode (**sparsity**).  
4. **Mix Results:** Experts' outputs are combined (weighted sum).  
5. **Output:** Final answer is given - fast and accurate.

**Analogy:** Making biryani with rice, masala, and veggie experts. Chef (router) decides the mix.

**Exam Tip:**
- Router = Gating network  
- Sparsity = Only necessary experts work

---

## 3. Main Parts of MoE

1. **Experts:** Small sub-models trained for one task (math, language, code)  
2. **Router / Gating Network:** Decides which expert(s) to use. Uses top-k selection, sometimes noisy  
3. **Mixer / Combiner:** Combines outputs from experts

**Exam Tip:** Experts = Parallel sub-models, Router = Input-dependent selector

## 4. Latest Developments in 2025

- **Dynamic Routing:** Router adapts based on input  
- **Trillion-Parameter Scale:** Models 1T+ parameters, only 10-20% active  
- **Hybrid MoE:** Dense + MoE mix  
- **More Experts:** 16-64 experts reduce bias

**Top Models 2025:**

| Model        | Experts | Active % | New Feature          |
|-------------|--------|----------|--------------------|
| Mixtral      | 8      | 20%      | Noisy routing       |
| Grok-2 (xAI) | 16     | 25%      | Hybrid reasoning    |
| Gemini Ultra | 32     | 15%      | Multimodal experts  |

**Exam Tip:** Dynamic routing = adaptable AI

## 5. Advantages and Disadvantages

**Pros:**
- Fast & cheap, only needed experts activate  
- Can scale to trillions of parameters  
- Better accuracy for specialized tasks  
- Flexible - prompts can control expert mix

**Cons:**
- Training is tricky, router may overload one expert  
- Router adds latency  
- Over-specialization may hurt general tasks  
- Each expert needs separate data

**Exam Tip:** Pros = efficiency & scalability, Cons = training complexity

---

## 6. MoE in LLMs

- Works token by token  
- Router selects expert(s) for each token  
- Experts predict next word, outputs combined  
- 2025: Multimodal MoE (text + images)

**Example:** "Write Python app code" → Router sends to code expert → Clean code output

**Exam Tip:** Sparsity = fast inference

---

## 7. Prompt Engineering & MoE

- `"As [expert]: Do [task]"` → forces routing  
- `"Mix experts: 60% math + 40% explain"` → custom mixture  
- Dynamic prompts adapt experts automatically

**Exam Tip:** Prompts act as external router

---

## 8. Real-World Examples

- **Mixtral:** 8 experts for chat, translation, code  
- **Grok:** Reasoning & fast text analysis  
- **Gemini:** Multimodal text + image experts

**Exam Tip:** Mixtral = open-source and affordable MoE

---

## 9. Future of MoE

- Hybrid dense + MoE  
- 2026: MoE on phones (low power AI)  
- Applications: Self-driving cars, personalized learning

**Exam Tip:** MoE for edge computing & mobile AI

---

## 10. Quick Recap

- MoE = Experts + Router + Sparsity = Efficiency  
- **Common Questions:**  
  - MoE vs Dense? → Sparse & faster  
  - Router purpose? → Selects experts  
- Practice: Draw diagrams, list 2025 models
